- Must annotate entity classes with @Entity.
- Must annotate entity classes with data class, unless specified in a prompt otherwise.
- Must annotate entity ID with @Id and @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY).
- Must use FetchType.LAZY for relationships, unless specified in a prompt otherwise.
- Annotate entity properties properly according to best practices, e.g., @Size, @NotEmpty, @Email, etc.
- For nullable fields, use Kotlin's nullable types
